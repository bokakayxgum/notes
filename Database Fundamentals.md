# Part 1: Understanding Databases
## What are Databases?

1.  Size – Scalable 
2.	Ease of updating – Accessible 
3.	Accuracy – Accurate 
4.	Security – Secure 
5.	Redundancy – Consistent 
6.	Importance – Permanent 
Database give us structure.

## Exploring Databases and Database Management Systems?

1. Example DBMS : Oracle, SQL Server, My SQL, Postgre SQL, MongoDB

2. DBMS Software
   ![1](1.PNG)
* DBMS software like Oracle or DB2 not installed on personal machine but on a separate server.
* Use that DBMS software to create or manage one or more databases.
* Database is your data and your rules about that data.
* Company can have multiple databases or DBMS management systems.

3. Relational DBMS
* Are the most widely used 
* Use the same principal across all offerings.
* Are foundational for understanding other systems

   * Each column describes one piece of data
   * It also says what type of the data must be\
   * DBMS system will not let us break them
   * Tables and columns are defined up front
   * Day-to-day use is in creating and updating rows

   

## Unique Values and Primary Keys

* Each column describes one piece of data

* It also says what type of the data must be

* DBMS system will not let us break them

* Tables and columns are defined up front

* Day-to-day use is in creating and updating rows
